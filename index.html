        <p>the Bennets, a family made upof a noisy mother, eccentric father, and five very unique daughters. The second eldest daughter, Elizabeth, is known to be the clever and high spirited</p>
        <p>heroine.The development of her relationship with the wealthy yet socially awkward aristrocrat, Fitzwilliam Darcy is the central focus of this novel's story. Initially, their impres-</p>
        <p>sions of each other had been unfavorable due to both character's hasty pride and judgements. However, as the story of progresses, the two begin to overcome their distaste for each-</p>

        <p>Though the concept of reputation comes up a lot throughout the novel, there is a heavy focus on how a woman is expected to present herself to the world. Elizabeth as a</p>
        <p>character, is a woman who refuses to adhere to the societal standards that are pushed onto women as she is stubborn and refuses to marry for any reasons that are not love, which causes</p>
        <p>her to clash with her mother who desires nothing more than to marry her daughters off for the sake of financial comfort. The themes of Pride and Prejudice are one of the most appreciated</p>
        <p>aspects of the novel as Austen artistically weaves together the themes of limitations imposed by social class, overcoming judgement, love transcending societal expectations and social ba-</p>
        <p>rriers, and family and sisterhood. As the title suggests, Elizabeth must overcome her prejudice and Darcy must set his pride aside.</p>
