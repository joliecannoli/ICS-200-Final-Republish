    <h1>Elizabeth Bennet</h1>
    <img src="lizzy.jpg" height="200" width="auto" class="center">
    <div class="a">
        <p>The second daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth is the protagonist and is often referred to as "Lizzy", or Eliza". Elizabeth is the most intelligent of her sisters</p>
        <p>as she is witty with a tongue that others percieve as too sharp for her own good. She is stubborn and stands out as though her circumstances push her to marry for the sake of her</p>
        <p>comfort and security, she wishes only to marry for love. Elizabeth Bennet is one of the most well known female characters in English literature as well as the most beloved and ad-</p>
        <p>mired of Jane Austen's heroines.</p>

    <h1>Fitzwilliam Darcy</h1>
    <img src="darcy.jpg" height="150" width="auto" class="center">
    <div class="b">
        <p>Fitzwilliam Darcy, generally referred to as "Mr.Darcy", is the nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh. He falls into the character archetype as an aloof romantic hero".</p>
        <p>Though he is judgmental towards those that are of the lower classes, he is a reserved gentleman which makes him come across as cold and prideful. Like Elizabeth, he also tends to</p>
        <p>judge harshly and hastily with his wealth playing a role in his "snobbylike" character. Elizabeth's rejections to his proposals builds humility in Darcy as he continues to demo-</p>
        <p>nstrate his devotion to her.</p>
    </div>
    <h1>Jane Bennet</h1>
    <img src="jane.jpg" height="170" width="auto" class="center">
    <div class="b">
        <p>Jane is the eldest sister who is considered to be the fairest by her mother. She is good hearted with a gentle nature that is almost opposite to Elizabeth's. Thro-</p>
        <p>ughout the novel, she continues to only see the best in people and often keeps Elizabeth in check for being judgemental. Her pleasantness in her interactions with Charles Bingley</p>
        <p>contrasts with the mutual distase between Elizabeth and Darcy's. Though Jane and Bingley's relationship is rather pleasant, it is not marked by the broad range of emotions that</p>
        <p>are shown in Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship.</p>
    <</div>
    <h1>Charles Bingley</h1>
    <img src="bingley.jpg" height="150" width="auto" class="center">
    <div class="b">
        <p>Bingley is Mr. Darcy's best friend. His easygoing nature contrasts with Darcy's initially prideful and haughty demeanor as he is uncaring about differneces due to</p>
        <p>social class. When Bingley first meets Jane, he is attracted to her and quickly falls in love with her. Though he often dances and speaks with her at balls, him and Jane are never</p>
        <p>really forward with their feelings toward each other, causing misconceptions in their relationship.</p>
